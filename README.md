This is a solution to the [Product list with cart challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-list-with-cart-5MmqLVAp_d). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**This project marks my first venture into using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion, and it's been an exciting learning experience!** Btw, I'm aware that the UI is over-animated, it was done on purpose.

This project is a frontend solution to a product list with a shopping cart. It was built to practice and demonstrate skills in **React, Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion**. The project is responsive and includes functionality to add items to the cart, view the cart summary, and confirm the order.
